# Library
This project is a library app that allows you to add and remove books to your own personal library, while being able to keep track of whether you have read them or not.

The fundamental point of tihs project was to practice my new knowldge of object constructors by using them to create new books to add in the library, per the Odin Project's Fullstack Javscript curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-objects-and-object-constructors

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.
